# Resume Descriptions: Emotional AI / Digital Organism

Here are several ways to describe this project on your resume, depending on the role you are applying for.

## Option 1: AI & Machine Learning Engineer Focus
**Project: Emotional AI Digital Organism**
*Designed and implemented a biologically-inspired emotional intelligence system that evolves personality through interaction.*
*   **Neurochemical Simulation**: Engineered a dynamic neurochemistry engine simulating Dopamine, Serotonin, Cortisol, and Oxytocin levels using differential equations to drive real-time emotional state changes.
*   **Adaptive LLM Inference**: Integrated Tinker API to perform dynamic LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) blending, adjusting model weights in real-time based on the agent's current emotional profile (e.g., blending "high_stress" adapters when Cortisol is elevated).
*   **Memory & Evolution**: Built a long-term memory system with emotional salience scoring, allowing the agent to form unique personality traits and behavioral patterns based on historical user interactions.
*   **Tech Stack**: Python, NumPy, Tinker API, LoRA Fine-tuning, Vector Embeddings.

## Option 2: Backend & Systems Engineering Focus
**Project: Scalable Emotional AI Backend**
*Built the core infrastructure for a stateful, emotionally responsive AI agent capable of real-time interaction.*
*   **Event-Driven Architecture**: Developed a high-performance FastAPI backend with WebSocket integration to handle real-time bi-directional communication between the user and the digital organism.
*   **System Integration**: Orchestrated a complex pipeline connecting a React/Next.js frontend, a Python-based neurochemistry engine, and external LLM inference services (Tinker API).
*   **Data Engineering**: Designed a robust SQL schema and JSONL-based training pipeline to manage emotional datasets, memory storage, and continuous model improvement.
*   **Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, WebSockets, PostgreSQL, Docker, Railway Deployment.

## Option 3: Creative Technologist / R&D Focus
**Project: Synthetic Sentience & Digital Life**
*Created a "Digital Organism" that exhibits genuine emotional reactions and emergent personality traits.*
*   **Emergent Behavior**: Programmed a system where personality is not hard-coded but emerges from the interplay of simulated hormones, environmental feedback, and accumulated memories.
*   **Human-Computer Interaction**: Designed an immersive interaction loop where the AI "feels" emotions (fear, joy, curiosity) in response to user tone and sentiment, creating a feedback loop of empathy and emotional contagion.
*   **Innovation**: Pioneered a novel approach to AI alignment by grounding LLM responses in a simulated biological substrate rather than static prompt engineering.

## Mix & Match Bullet Points
*   Developed a **neuro-symbolic AI architecture** combining differential equations for emotional state with Large Language Models for natural language generation.
*   Implemented **dynamic LoRA adapter blending** to modulate LLM output style and tone in real-time based on simulated internal state.
*   Built a **comprehensive memory system** that prioritizes retention based on emotional intensity (Salience), simulating human-like memory consolidation.
*   Engineered a **real-time feedback loop** where user sentiment directly impacts the agent's simulated neurochemistry (Dopamine, Cortisol, etc.).
*   Deployed a **full-stack application** using Next.js, FastAPI, and WebSockets to demonstrate the emotional AI in a live, interactive environment.
